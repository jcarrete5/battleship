The universe is always expanding.

Computers can process millions of instructions
per second. They are only getting faster!
A phone processor now is way more powerful
than the processors NASA used in the past!

Moore's law is the observation that the number of
transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles
approximately every two years.
